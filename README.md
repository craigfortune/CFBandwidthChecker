CFBandwidthChecker
==================

Some simple python code that gives you a physical output for your current bandwidth conditions

Running the script will update the GPIO pin settings on pins defined within the script. The pins could be hooked up to 3 LEDs to show 3 different (4 including off) bandwidth states.

The default settings are 2, 4 and 6mbit/sec on pins 11, 12 and 15.
